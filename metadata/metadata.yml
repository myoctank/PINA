name: 'PINA: Physics-Informed Neural networks for Advanced modeling'
description: PINA is an open-source Python library that mainly aims to solve problems
  defined by differential equations, providing a continuous and nonlinear approximation
  by means of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Built on top of the PyTorch
  library, it automatically inherits all the features of such a framework, like the
  autograd module, or the GPU support. Thanks to PINA, a large variety of different
  problems (time-dependent, parametric) can be formalized and solved using the PINNs
  methodology.
